# AI Forester Field Companion App
## Project Overview
The AI Forester Field Companion is a mobile application designed for forestry professionals who need to perform field calculations and assessments while working in remote areas. The app is specifically optimized for field use with offline functionality, battery conservation features, and interfaces designed for outdoor visibility.
Built with React Native and Expo, this app leverages AI capabilities to enhance traditional forestry calculations and provides a suite of field tools that help professionals make data-driven decisions directly from the field.
## Key Features
- **Offline Functionality**: All calculations and tools work without internet connection
- **Field Data Collection**: Capture and store field measurements efficiently
- **Culvert Sizing Tool**: Calculate proper culvert sizes based on watershed characteristics
- **Cross-platform**: Works on both iOS and Android devices
- **GPS Integration**: Capture location data for field cards
- **PDF Export**: Generate professional reports with images and comments
- **Climate Adaptation**: Optional climate change projection factors
- **Low Battery Usage**: Optimized for extended field use
- **Photo Documentation**: Capture and annotate field photos directly in the app
- **Quick Photo Capture**: Floating camera button for instant photo access from anywhere
- **Dynamic Forms**: Customizable field forms with validation
## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v16+)
- Expo CLI
- Expo Go app on your mobile device
- Git
### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/davidbeleznay/ai-forester-rebuild.git
cd ai-forester-rebuild
```
2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```
3. Start the development server:
```bash
npx expo start --clear
```
4. Run on a device:
   - Scan the QR code with Expo Go app on your physical device

### Troubleshooting Bundling Issues
If you encounter bundling errors, try the following steps:
```bash
# Remove node_modules completely (Windows)
rmdir /s /q node_modules

# Or on macOS/Linux
rm -rf node_modules

# Install dependencies again
npm install

# Start with a completely clean cache
npx expo start -c
```

## Culvert Sizing Methods
The app provides two methods for calculating culvert sizes:
### California Method
The primary calculation approach is the California Method for nonfish streams. This approach:
1. Takes stream measurements (top width and depth) along with an optional bottom width
2. Uses a simplified trapezoidal formula to calculate the cross-sectional area
3. Multiplies by 3 to determine the end opening area needed for the culvert
4. Uses both a lookup table and area-based calculation to determine the recommended size
5. Flags installations that require professional engineering design

### Commercial Culvert Sizes
The app supports the following standard commercial culvert sizes (in mm):
- 300, 400, 500, 600, 700, 800, 900, 1000, 1200, 1400, 1500, 1600, 1800, 1900, 2000
- Sizes 2000mm or larger automatically receive a professional engineering design recommendation

### Area-Based Method
As a fallback when stream measurements aren't available, the app offers a simplified area-based calculation that:
1. Uses watershed area and precipitation intensity
2. Calculates flow using a runoff coefficient
3. Converts flow to a recommended culvert diameter
4. Rounds up to the nearest standard culvert size
## Water Transport Potential (WTP) Assessment
The app includes a transport and debris assessment feature that evaluates the potential for sediment and woody debris to affect culvert performance:
1. **Input Parameters**:
   - Bankfull width rating (Low: ≤2m, Medium: >2-3.5m, High: >3.5m)
   - Sediment in storage wedges (Low: ≤100mm, Medium: >100-200mm, High: >200mm)
   - Water-transported woody debris (None, Small, Large, Logs)
2. **Transport Index**:
   - Calculates a weighted index based on these parameters
   - Applies additional sizing factors when debris risk is medium or high
   - Provides specific installation recommendations for high-debris situations
3. **Design Recommendations**:
   - Suggests design features like beveled inlets and outlet aprons when appropriate
   - Recommends maintenance approaches for culverts in high-debris environments

## Field Documentation Features
The app provides comprehensive field documentation capabilities:

1. **Field Notes**: 
   - Add detailed site observations and recommendations
   - Notes are stored with assessment data for future reference
   - Supports multiline text for thorough documentation

2. **Photo Documentation**:
   - Capture photos directly within the app using the floating camera button
   - Floating button available throughout the app for quick access
   - Import existing photos from device gallery
   - Add detailed notes to individual photos
   - Central photo gallery for managing all field photos
   - Organize photos with field assessments
   - All photos work completely offline

3. **Enhanced PDF Reports**:
   - Generate professional PDF reports with field data
   - Include site photos with their annotations
   - Customize reports with field notes and observations
   - Share reports directly from the field
   - All report generation works offline

## Offline Functionality
The app is built to work entirely offline, making it ideal for remote field work:

1. **Robust Offline Storage**:
   - All data is stored locally on the device
   - Calculations and tools work without any internet connection
   - Field cards are saved automatically and persistently
   - Secure storage of measurements, notes, and photos

2. **Network Status Awareness**:
   - Real-time monitoring of connection status
   - Clear indication of online/offline state
   - Automatic handling of network transitions
   - Data integrity preserved during connectivity changes

3. **Intelligent Synchronization**:
   - Changes made offline are tracked and queued
   - Automatic synchronization when connection is restored
   - Prioritized sync queue to handle critical data first
   - Detailed sync status and history available

4. **Offline-First Design**:
   - All features work without internet dependency
   - Report generation and sharing fully functional offline
   - Complete field assessments in areas with no connectivity
   - Seamless experience regardless of connection state

5. **Data Management**:
   - Conflict resolution for changes made on multiple devices
   - Queue management for pending synchronizations
   - Retry mechanisms for failed operations
   - Clear visibility into sync status and pending changes

## Dynamic Form System
The app includes a flexible form system that allows for:

1. **Customizable Field Forms**:
   - Modify form field labels and placeholders
   - Adjust the order of fields
   - Toggle whether fields are required
   - Form configuration persists across app sessions

2. **Field Validation**:
   - Built-in validation for required fields
   - Type-specific validation for numeric inputs
   - Custom validation functions for complex requirements
   - Immediate feedback on validation errors

3. **Form Dependencies**:
   - Show/hide fields based on other field values
   - Conditional validation based on form state
   - Support for complex form workflows

4. **Form Configuration UI**:
   - Admin interface for customizing forms
   - No-code approach to form modifications
   - Reset to default configuration option

## Developer Notes

### Project Structure
The app uses a modular structure with a focus on maintainability. Key files include:

1. **SavedFormsScreen.js**:
   - Contains the implementation for the Saved Forms screen
   - Previously was causing bundling issues, but now unified with SavedFormsScreen2.js
   - Includes inline implementation of report generation functionality

2. **MainNavigator.js**:
   - Handles all app navigation
   - Uses explicit imports to avoid resolution issues

3. **Utilities**:
   - PDF generation functionality is implemented directly within components
   - This approach eliminates external dependencies and improves bundling reliability

### Troubleshooting
- If encountering bundling errors, try a complete clean reinstall as described in the Installation section
- Make sure to use a clean cache when starting Expo after major changes
